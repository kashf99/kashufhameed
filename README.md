# Responsive Flutter Portfolio Application & Website

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website repository. This Flutter-based website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, certifications, and ways to get in touch with me. The website is designed with a strong focus on responsiveness, ensuring that it looks and works flawlessly across a range of devices, from large desktop screens to compact Android devices.



Once the website is up and running, you'll find a range of sections to explore:

- **Home:** The landing page welcomes with an introduction of the website's contents and purpose.
- **Projects:** Navigate through my various projects, which I have created and are available on web, appstore and google play store.
- **Education:** Explore my qualifications and certifications.
- **Contact:** Reach out to me through provided contact details or social media links.
